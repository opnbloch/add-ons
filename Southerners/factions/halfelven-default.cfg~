"+_"The <bold>text='Halfelven'</bold> is a unique stand alone faction . Their homeland is in south-western parts of the Great Continent (Irdya), beyond the Black River. Halfelven use terrain features to coordinate attacks at dawn or dusk. Among them are paramedics, high-accuracy slingers, spearmen, leaders, weapon- and armour-bearers, phoenix scouting birds, and protective golems. Halfelven units are defensive and costly but level up quicker due to their surpassing intelligence and sophistication."
