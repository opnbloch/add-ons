     - Descriptive Synopsis: Halfelven
"The Halfelven are an ancient set aside faction from the southern side of the Black River. Their homeland is an arcadian country with hills, meadows, shores, ashlar ramparts, incredible metalworks and artifacts of arcane-hardened bronze. Lacking pugnacity, they combine liminal and neutral units. They are mobile, safeguard, and use terrain characteristics for hit and run tactics at dawn or dusk. The units are defensive and costly but level up quicker due to their surpassing intelligence and sophistication. Among them are paramedics, weapon- and armour-bearers, tame scouting birds, and protective golems."
