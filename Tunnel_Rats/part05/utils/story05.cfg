# Geographical assumptions:
# #
# This campaign was designed before the geography of
# 'Wesnoth's Southern Lands' was well defined and fixed.
# There are very sparse references to it online, see:
# (http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Geography_Of_Wesnoth#The_Southern_Land)
# This campaign plays in the classical era,
# meaning before 1YW and the founding of Wesnoth
# but after prehistorical times, though.
# It is set beyond the Black River and
# in the frontier area south of the "River Aethen",
# thus the reference to R. Kerlath being:
# "in the furthermost south"
# and in the vicinity of the "Black River".
# The "elvish woods" are: Aethenwood, Southwood.
# The Black Forest is special.
# The Lillin (kind of dark-elves) do live in there.
# Some of their cities and other folks
# are introduced in the enfolding storyline.
# None of it might be seen as 'canonical'.
# However, it integrates well with Wesnoth's history
# and the dunefolk campaign 'Oath of Allegiance'.

because it is an episode of fantasy legend from the classical era
that situates us alongside Wesnoth's very early history."
