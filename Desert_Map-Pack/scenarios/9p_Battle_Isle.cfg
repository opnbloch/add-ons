    description= _ "A challenge for 3 teams on an a small 3 vs 3 vs 3 battle-isle map.  The teams are players 1&5&9 vs. 2&6&7 vs. 3&4&8 (north vs. southeast vs. southwest). With only few villages per player, 3 gold per villages would be advised; and due to the number of players involved, a 60 sec timer is recommended."
