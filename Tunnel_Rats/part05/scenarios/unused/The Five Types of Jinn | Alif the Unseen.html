<p>The Five Types of Jinn&nbsp;and Their Threat to Your Digital Security
</p></div>
<p>Islamic belief divides sentient beings into three categories. In 
order of creation,&nbsp;they are: the angels (malayka), the hidden ones 
(jinn), and humankind (nas or&nbsp;banu adam). Angels are made out of 
light, jinn out of fire, men out of earth (sometimes translated as mud 
or clay). Angels are considered neither male nor&nbsp;female and have no
 free will. Jinn, like humans, are gendered, and have free 
will.&nbsp;(This is why, in Islamic thought, Satan is a jinn, not an 
angel; it would be impossible&nbsp;for an angel to disobey the will of 
God.) Jinn may be benevolent, evil, or&nbsp;neutral, but are generally 
regarded as less trustworthy and more prone to trickery&nbsp;than 
people, even if they are benign. In addition to the types of jinn 
mentioned&nbsp;here, there are many lesser varieties of jinn that appear
 in local legends that vary&nbsp;from place to place. For example, in 
Egypt, there are thought to be female jinn&nbsp;who inhabit the canals 
and tributaries of the Nile and lure men to their deaths,&nbsp;much like
 sirens, but they don’t appear elsewhere in the Arab world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MARID</strong> &nbsp;(pronounced MAA–rid)<br>
Large and imposing, the marid are&nbsp;considered the most powerful 
tribe of&nbsp;jinn. They are the classic genies of&nbsp;folklore, often 
portrayed as barrelchested&nbsp;men with booming voices.<br>
Originally sea-spirits, they are often&nbsp;associated with water, and 
thought to&nbsp;take sanctuary in the open ocean.&nbsp;While marid are 
very powerful, they&nbsp;are not technically minded and 
therefore&nbsp;unlikely to infect your hard drive.&nbsp;However, there 
is at least one known&nbsp;case of a marid being imprisoned in 
a&nbsp;flash drive and doing quite a lot of&nbsp;damage to the operating
 system,&nbsp;attempting to free itself. Please be&nbsp;aware when 
opening any unfamiliar&nbsp;attachments and if any of your 
computer’s&nbsp;peripherals exhibit a telltale&nbsp;blue-gray cast, 
please disconnect from&nbsp;your machine and take them to 
a&nbsp;qualified technician.</p>

<p><strong>EFFRIT</strong><br>
(pronounced eff–FREET)<br>
Intelligent and cunning, the effrit&nbsp;are thought to live in complex 
societies&nbsp;similar to those of humans. They&nbsp;are said to prefer 
caves and under&nbsp;ground dwellings. Though ostensibly&nbsp;demonic, 
they are portrayed as&nbsp;changeable in nature, and capable 
of&nbsp;becoming pious and good. In the&nbsp;Quran, King Solomon is said
 to have&nbsp;had power over a tribe of effrit, who&nbsp;performed 
various tasks for him.</p>
<p>Effrit are the greatest risk for&nbsp;phishing scams and online 
privacy&nbsp;violations, as they are natural schemers&nbsp;and also 
understand human&nbsp;personality and social interaction the&nbsp;best. 
It is thought that quite a few&nbsp;effrit amuse themselves sending 
Facebook&nbsp;messages to attractive potential&nbsp;mates using the 
profiles of call center&nbsp;employees and programmers in&nbsp;India, 
the Middle East, and the Philippines,&nbsp;who are bewildered by 
the&nbsp;response. More seriously, however,&nbsp;some effrit have the 
capability of&nbsp;writing code themselves, and it is&nbsp;thought that 
the Conficker worm,&nbsp;which infected some fifty 
million&nbsp;computers worldwide, may have&nbsp;been written by a group 
combining&nbsp;effrit and human members. Effrit are&nbsp;not to be taken
 lightly, but they can&nbsp;only be guarded against by the 
standard&nbsp;information safety protocols&nbsp;used with human 
threats—be wary&nbsp;of unverified interlocutors and 
executable&nbsp;content, and if your system&nbsp;slows or behaves oddly,
 conduct a&nbsp;thorough scan or contact your IT&nbsp;professional.</p>

<strong>GHOUL</strong><br>
(Arabic pronunciation uses&nbsp;a guttural gg sound somewhere<br>
between an English G&nbsp;and a French R)</p>
<p>This tribe of jinn has traveled north&nbsp;and west to become a 
common English-&nbsp;language term for “undead&nbsp;monster.” This is 
pretty close to its&nbsp;original Arabic connotation; ghouls&nbsp;are 
thought to be zombie-like jinn&nbsp;who haunt graveyards and prey 
on&nbsp;human flesh. They are strictly demonic&nbsp;and incapable of 
goodness. Often portrayed&nbsp;as nocturnal. Given their&nbsp;limited 
intelligence, ghouls are low&nbsp;risk in the information 
technology&nbsp;world—but you really don’t want to&nbsp;run into one in a
 dark alley.</p>

SILA</strong><br>
Talented shape-shifters who are&nbsp;more tolerant of human society 
than&nbsp;other tribes of jinn, sila are most&nbsp;often portrayed as 
female. Thought&nbsp;to be extremely intelligent, sila 
are&nbsp;nonetheless the most rarely seen of all&nbsp;the types of jinn,
 and appear only&nbsp;sporadically in folklore. There 
is&nbsp;speculation that the term sila might&nbsp;be related to seelie, a
 Middle English&nbsp;word for “a good faerie.” (This would&nbsp;make 
sense, as sila does not appear to&nbsp;correspond to an Arabic root 
pattern.)&nbsp;Sila are extremely rare, both&nbsp;on- and off-line, and 
while they are &nbsp;intelligent and comfortable crossing&nbsp;back and 
forth between realms seen&nbsp;and unseen/human and jinn, by 
their&nbsp;nature they do not usually set out to&nbsp;harm or trick 
humans. Sila are, however,&nbsp;fond of meddling in an attempt&nbsp;to 
help. That Livejournal community&nbsp;member who intervened when 
you&nbsp;got overinvolved with that troll in&nbsp;the George R.R. Martin
 community?</p>
<p>Possibly a sila<br>

</strong><br>
The original vampires, vetala are&nbsp;semi-malevolent spirits from 
ancient&nbsp;Indian folklore. They can possess&nbsp;human corpses and 
prevent them&nbsp;from decaying, and in so doing trick&nbsp;human beings
 into believing the&nbsp;vetala is an ordinary person. 
However,&nbsp;vetala can also change shape at&nbsp;will. They are 
thought to be natural&nbsp;psychics, able to foretell the 
future&nbsp;and gain insight into the past, as well&nbsp;as read the 
thoughts of others. The&nbsp;most famous vetala appears in 
“The&nbsp;Vampire and King Vikram,” a set of&nbsp;stories from the 
Baital Pachisi. Vetala&nbsp;are quite rare, and while they are 
certainly&nbsp;intelligent enough to threaten&nbsp;your computer, their 
superior mental&nbsp;and psychic abilities make technology&nbsp;somewhat
 irrelevant to their&nbsp;needs. To the extent you are likely 
to&nbsp;encounter a vetala online, it is likely&nbsp;posing 
brain-twisting rhetorical&nbsp;questions that keep you on a 
messageboard&nbsp;well past your bedtime.</p>
<p>Always remember that the unseen&nbsp;can take on disproportionate 
power&nbsp;—which goes for genies and online&nbsp;demagogues in equal 
measure. If&nbsp;your blood pressure rises, step away&nbsp;from the 
computer and make a cup&nbsp;of tea. Vetala are also extremely 
fond&nbsp;of Words With Friends—they are&nbsp;excellent players and lots
 of fun to&nbsp;engage with, even if their superior&nbsp;skill may prove
 frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information technology specialists have been working for some time to
 identify&nbsp;and profile the unique online habits of jinn, in order to
 better protect human&nbsp;users. However, after the disastrous outcome 
of the Tin Sari program, there is&nbsp;a general consensus that the 
likelihood of abuse of this program to target&nbsp;benevolent jinn is 
too great a risk. Until a better solution presents itself, 
surf&nbsp;carefully, and if you believe your computer has been attacked 
by jinn, contact&nbsp;your IT professional.</p>
