a rather short narrative poem or a separate episode within a longer piece of epic poetry.
The latter would be just the proper characterization for our enfolding campaign,
because it is an episode of fantasy legend from the classical era
that situates us alongside Wesnoth's very early history."

			story=_"The background of our epyllion starts in the year 12 BW (Before Wesnoth),
when the then elder Crown Prince of Southbay
on the Green Isle discovers the Great Continent. But in the following years he dies
and the Green Isle is overrun with Orcs.
His brother, Prince Haldric, leads most of the folk on their rescue
to the Pearl Bay at the shores of the Great Continent."
